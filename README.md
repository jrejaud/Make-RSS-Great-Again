Before social media feeds (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Youtube ect) took over the internet, the web of ~ a decade ago used to rely more on RSS. Websites/Blogs had RSS icons (the orange thing with the wifi logo tilted at an angle) that generated RSS Feeds when you clicked on them. You would then add that RSS Feed to your RSS app of choice and be able to read multiple RSS feeds from multiple sources inside a single app.

The way the internet works now (without RSS), you have to interface with each platform's individual proprietary app in order to see if they have updates. For example, you check the Facebook app to see your Facebook feed, you check the Twitter app to see your Twitter feed, ect.

With RSS, you can "pipe" all those feeds into a single app (aka an RSS client) and get all your updates in a single app. You can also use external tools (not included in this app) to pipe some of your email to RSS, you can essentially pipe anything into RSS!

Some famous RSS clients include: 
- Feedly, https://feedly.com/
- newsboat, (for the command line inclined)
- https://alternativeto.net/browse/search?q=rss 

You query the net to find others. RSS is an open format, so you can even write your own client (if you are so inclined).
